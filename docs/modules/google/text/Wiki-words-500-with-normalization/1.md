# Module google/text/Wiki-words-500-with-normalization/1
Word2vec based text embedding trained on English Wikipedia corpus.

**Module URL:** https://storage.googleapis.com/tfhub-test-modules/google/text/Wiki-words-500-with-normalization/1.tar.gz

## Overview

Text embedding based on skipgram version of word2vec with 1 out-of-vocabulary
bucket. Maps from text to 500-dimensional embedding vectors.

#### Example use
```
embed = hub.Module("https://storage.googleapis.com/tfhub-test-modules/google/text/Wiki-words-500-with-normalization/1.tar.gz")
embeddings = embed(["cat is on the mat", "dog is in the fog"])
```

## Details
Skipgram model, hierarchical softmax, sub-sampling 1e-5.

#### Input
The module takes **a batch of sentences in a 1-D tensor of strings** as input.

#### Preprocessing
The module preprocesses its input by **removing punctuation and splitting on spaces**.
