# Module google/image/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/1

**Module URL:** https://storage.googleapis.com/tfhub-test-modules/google/image/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/1.tar.gz

## Overview

Inception V3 is a neural network architecture for image classification,
originally published by

Christian Szegedy, Vincent Vanhoucke, Sergey Ioffe, Jonathon Shlens,
Zbigniew Wojna: ["Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer
Vision"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567), 2015.

This TF-Hub module uses the TF-Slim implementation of `inception_v3`.
The module contains a trained instance of the network, packaged to get
[feature vectors from images](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/docs/common_signatures/images.md#image-feature-vector).
If you want the full model including the classification it was originally
trained for, use module
[`google/image/imagenet/inception_v3/classification/1`](../classification/1.md)
instead.


## Training

The checkpoint exported into this module was `inception_v3_2016_08_28/inception_v3.ckpt` downloaded
from
[TF-Slim's pre-trained models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/README.md#pre-trained-models).
Its weights were originally obtained by training on the ILSVRC-2012-CLS
dataset for image classification ("Imagenet").


## Usage

This module implements the common signature for computing
[image feature vectors](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/docs/common_signatures/images.md#image-feature-vector).
It can be used like

```python
images = ...  # A batch of images with shape [batch_size, height, width, 3].
module = hub.Module("https://storage.googleapis.com/tfhub-test-modules/google/image/imagenet/inception_v3/feature_vector/1.tar.gz")
features = module(images)  # Features with shape [batch_size, num_features].
```

...or using the signature name `image_feature_vector`.

The input `images` are expected to have color values in the range [0,1],
following the [common image input](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/docs/common_signatures/images.md#image-input)
conventions. The default image size for this module is
299x299 pixels.


## Fine-tuning

Consumers of this module can [fine-tune](https://github.com/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/README.md#fine-tuning) it.
This requires importing the graph version with tag set `["train"]`
in order to operate batch normalization in training mode.
