# Installation

Currently, TensorFlow Hub depends on bug fixes and enhancements not present in a
stable TensorFlow release. For now, please [install or
upgrade](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) your TensorFlow package past
1.7.0rc0. For instance:

```bash
$ pip install "tensorflow>=1.7.0rc0"
$ pip install tensorflow-hub
```

This section will be updated to include a specific TensorFlow version
requirement when a compatible release is made available.
